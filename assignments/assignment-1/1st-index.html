<h1>Introduction:</h1>

<p>It’s a social media world now. Image is one of the most important components for social media. 
    Instagram is a image based platform, users could share their lives there with sharing photos with content, or videos. 
    Because of this, the demand of high quality image are being highly needed for posters. Especially, when people want to get 
    more followers, or likes. The hotter the post is, the more money you can make. In this case, stealing others’ images or videos 
    is a common phenomenon in Instagram. This inspired me to think what if instagram can create a watermark with a function of 
    taking users to the original post when downloading or screenshotting others’ images? </p>
