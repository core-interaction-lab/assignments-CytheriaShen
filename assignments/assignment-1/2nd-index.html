    <h1>Narrative:</h1>
    <h2>David is a photographer, he used to post his beautiful photos on Twitter, but he notices another account is stealing his work, posts them as if they own it. There are too many accounts that steal image from him. Although he reported to Twitter, but it still can’t change the phenomenon. He is worried about the same thing might be happens again. Then,  he sent a snapchat to his friend about how to protect his own rights on social media. His friend told him Instagram has a function of forming a watermark when downloading or screenshot the images, and it will take the person to the first poster. At first, he doesn’t believe this, so he begins to google the credibility of it, then he saw there are many users prise the Instagram watermark function. He finally decides to use Instagram as his main artwork platform.</h2>
