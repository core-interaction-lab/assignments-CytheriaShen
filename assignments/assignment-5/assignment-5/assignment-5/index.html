                    Once upon a time, a princess named <span class="input-value" data-input="input-1"></span>, 
                    lived in a castle with her father, the King, and her stepmother, 
                    the Queen. Her father had always said to his daughter that she must be 
                    fair to everyone at court. 
                    <span class="input-value" data-input="input-2"></span> 
                    , “People come here to the castle when they have a problem. 
                    They need the ruler to make a fair decision. Nothing is more important 
                    than to be fair.” <span class="input-value" data-input="input-3"></span> 
                    Snow White’s stepmother, knew how much this meant to her husband. At the first chance,
                     she went to her magic mirror.  “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the 
                     fairest of them all?” "
                    <span class="input-value" data-input="input-4"></span> is the fairest of them all!” said the
                     Magic Mirror. <span class="input-value" data-input="input-5"></span> 
                     “What?!” yelled the Queen.  “No one is more fair than I!  The Queen must have the best 
                     of everything - everyone knows that.  What could be more fair than that?” "
                     <span class="input-value" data-input="input-6"></span> is the fairest of them all!” repeated
                      the Magic Mirror. “What do you know – you’re a mirror!” roared the Queen.  And she stormed off.
